# Toggleable sidebar menu
it's a training project in which 
I wanted to recreate what could be a menu for an app or site admin interface.

## ðŸ›  Skills
 HTML, CSS, javascript


## Description
Case 1: the menu opens by clicking on the logo with a slide to the left.
Once the menu is open, if you click on any item in the menu it will open a sub-menu by sliding downwards.

Case 2: if with the menu closed, you click directly on an item in the menu, it will open both the sidebar and the submenu.

Finally even if you have zero, one or more sub-menus open if you click on the logo it will close everything.
